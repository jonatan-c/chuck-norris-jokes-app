### App of Chuck Norris Jokes 


## Installation

npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm run dev

React with TypeScript was used for the development of the application. A state manager like Redux was not used since the application did not require it. Axios was used for API consumption, and Tailwind was used for the UI to expedite the development process.
